# php-ddd
This repository was originally designed to bring Domain-driven Design, CQRS and Event-Sourcing to the PHP world focussing on implementing the Symfony Framework and Doctrine ORM and ODM.

Over the years the proposals turned into general questions and discussions about these topics and are no longer related to a concrete code base.

Feel free to open up an issue and start a new discussion and link to related posts.

You are welcome!
